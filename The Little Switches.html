These rubber-domes aren't just the switches that are in the $10 keyboards that come with many retail PC's today, they are Topre Rubber-Dome Switches. This means they are still very high-end, but this is the technology that eventually brought the world cheap keyboards. Although the technology was cheap and still good, the keyswitches didn't last nearly as long as the mechanical switches seen on other past keyboards.</p>
